Project Description:

This project explores artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning, using python.
The primary goal is to build a python program to play a simple arcade-style game.

The target file is a game called Cave Runner, which is a side scrolling action game that
involves a player that must continuously move through a cavern while avoiding various obstacles.
There are only two actions that can be controlled, jump and dash, which the runner activates
to avoid pits, land on platforms, avoid/killand  monsters, avoid falling objects. 

The project objectives are to get python to play the game independently, while utilizing a set
of simple AI strategies which will be compared for degrees of success.

Statistical analysis on each AI strategy will provide feedback on which strategies should be executed
against the various levels of the game. With this analysis, the AI will be able to choose a specific
strategy for each level that will provide optimum success. Since the game is procedurally generated
from a finite set of programmed levels, the AI can be expanded as needed to address each challenge
independently. 

Program Structure:

main.py is the main module that initiates the AI by setting up a dedicated thread to launch the game
window and gets its coordinates. Then it begins tracking the objects generated by the game window.
These tasks are controlled with the following modules:
  open_game.py
  game_interaction.py
  find_objects.py
 
 game_interaction.py handles clicking the mouse to start the game and pressing and releasing a key to
 control the player actions.
 
 find_objects.py is in charge of identifying objects in the game window. It draws a green rectangle 
 around each object to provide visual feedback that the AI can identify necessary objects to react to.
 The module proceeds to record snapshot images of the screen to display in a seperate window while
 simultaneously providing coordinates for each object that will be used by the AI.
